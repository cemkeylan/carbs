CARBS
=====

Cem's Auto Rice Bootstrapping Script

CARBS installs a fully functional desktop environment.


Installation
------------

Carbs can be installed by typing

bash -c "(curl -L cemkeylan.com/carbs)"

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and simply execute the script.


Usage
-----

carbs [options]
  -p <progs.csv>      Use an alternative progs.csv file (must be local)
  -r <repo url>       Use an alternative dotfiles repo
  -d <location>       Specify another place to install dotfiles
  -n		      Run the script noninteractively (Requires sudo)
  -P <filename>       Download progs.csv and exit

  -h/--help	      Print this help message (to the terminal)


Requirements
------------

CARBS work on almost all Arch-based distros (almost all because I did not have 
the chance try out Parabola), and all architechtures that can run Arch Linux

It is always best to have a fresh install


Ideas and Suggestions
---------------------

If you have problems, or suggestions feel free to send me a mail at cem (at) ckyln dot com <cem@ckyln.com>


Known Issues
------------

On architechtures other than x86_64 and aarch64, there is a problem installing yay, 
although you can build yay everywhere you can install Go. I am currently trying to make a workaround for that.
