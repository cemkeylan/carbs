# CARBS
**This is not a fork of LARBS**


I wanted to make a custom script that will make it easy for people to install my rice. However, this is really an amateur grade script.

I have successfully tested this script on a
1. Fresh install of Arch x86_64 x86
1. Fresh install of Manjaro x86_64 x86
1. Fresh install of Anarchy Linux x86_64

## Architectures
Currently, this script runs very well on 64-bit. You can install it on 32-bit as well, however, there are some problems with compton on 32-bit, I am looking into that. ARMv8 (or aarch64, you name it) currently does NOT work. My plan for ARM is to create a new rice and integrate it into this script.

## The name CARBS

Yeah, I like Luke Smith. But there a few reasons this script is called CARBS.
1. My name is Cem, lol.
1. I am not aiming to be a bloat-free, POSIX compliant script writer like Luke. This script is bloated. Like carbohydrates, or carbs. Most of the Arch users use Bash, and 99% of the users have it installed anyway, so I ain't going to bother myself writing a POSIX shell script.
1. Okay, the biggest reason is Carbohydrates. It makes me giggle every time I use the script.
